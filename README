Fourthquare
==============

Fourthquare is a Common Lisp wrapper for the foursquare API.


Currently it is a work in progress, but all endpoints are supported through the get-value and query functions.

$> (get-value (user-data my-user) data "user" "checkins" "items")

or

$> (query (user-authenticator user) "user/self")

etc.
